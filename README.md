# newGRAPH - upgraded Java
This repository contains only the jar for the original newGRAPH application, with updated dependencies that enable application to be run on Java 17+

To run the jar, just run

Upgrade of newGRAPH is a work in progress. If you have any questions/suggestions, please contact me at marko643@gmail.com
